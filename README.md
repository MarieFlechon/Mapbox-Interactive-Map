# Interactive Map Website with React and Mapbox üó∫Ô∏è

This project is a web application that displays an interactive map powered by Mapbox. Users can explore various locations, zoom in and out, and interact with the map to view specific details. The website is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and Mapbox, a mapping platform that provides customizable maps and powerful location-based services.

## Features

- **Interactive Map:** Users can pan, zoom, and click on the map to view detailed information about specific locations.
- **Custom Markers:** The application displays custom markers on the map to highlight points of interest.
- **Responsive Design:** The website is designed to be responsive and can be accessed on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Map GL:** A React wrapper for Mapbox GL JS, a JavaScript library that uses WebGL to render interactive maps.
- **Mapbox:** A mapping platform for customizing maps and integrating location-based services.
- **HTML/CSS:** Standard web technologies for structuring and styling the user interface.
